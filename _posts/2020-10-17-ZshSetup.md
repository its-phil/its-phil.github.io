A quick log of setting up ZSH on Ubuntu with KDE.

Following the instructions from https://kifarunix.com/install-and-setup-zsh-and-oh-my-zsh-on-ubuntu-20-04/.

1. Install prerequisites
   ```
   sudo apt install wget curl git -y
   ```
2. Install zsh itself
   ```
   sudo apt install zsh -y
   ```
3. Set up zsh as default shell
   ```
   chsh -s $(which zsh)
   ```
4. Install Oh My Zsh
   ```
   sudo sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
   ```
5. Back up the Oh My Zsh configuration
   ```
   mv .zshrc .zshrc_ohmyzsh
   ```
6. Get my personal zsh configuration
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/its-phil/DailyHelpers.git
   ```
7. Link the config file into the user directory
   ```
   ln -s ~/gpr/DailyHelpers/linux/zsh/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
   ```
8. Install the fonts (might already be installed on Ubuntu)
   ```
   sudo apt install powerline-fonts
   ```
   On my Ubuntu system the last step didn't make my preferred font 'Source Code Pro' available. I had to install it from here: https://misterpinchy.wordpress.com/2012/09/25/use-source-code-pro-font-in-an-ubuntu-terminal/.
9. Change the font in the terminal's current profile to Source Code Pro.
